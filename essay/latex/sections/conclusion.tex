\textbf{[PLACEHOLDER - Section to be completed]}

We presented the first complete implementation of PQ-NTOR for space-air-ground integrated networks, achieving 31 \us\ handshake latency and demonstrating negligible overhead in satellite scenarios across 12 network topologies.

Future work includes hybrid mode support, ARM optimization, and integration with the production Tor network.
